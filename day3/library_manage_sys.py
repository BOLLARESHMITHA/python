"""
You are building a Library Management System in Python. The system should store books in a dictionary where:
Key â†’ Book ID
Value â†’ Book Title
Write a Python program to perform the following operations using Dictionaries:
1 Add a book to the library (Book ID, Title).
2 Remove a book using Book ID.
3 Search for a book by Book ID and display the title.
4 Update the title of a book (e.g., correction in title).
5 Display all books in the library.
6 Count the total number of books in the library.
7 Check if a book title exists in the library (reverse lookup).
